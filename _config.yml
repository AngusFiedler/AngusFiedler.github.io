description: As a Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin, I develop Java and C++ software to support mission management. I enjoy working in an agile environment where I can collaborate with other engineers to deliver secure, modern, and efficient code solutions.
Before joining Lockheed Martin, I gained valuable experience as a Student Software Engineer at the Laboratory For Atmospheric and Space Physics, where I created a full-stack application using Python to demonstrate application design. I also have multiple certifications in lifeguarding and pool operation, which reflect my passion for aquatic safety and leadership. I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2022, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. My goal is to continue to grow as a software engineer and contribute to meaningful and impactful projects.
